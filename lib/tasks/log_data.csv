Prevent Spree::Base from overriding Rails 5 default belongs_to validation",""
298,4806392745a9bbef279e90c828021720f6f26308,"",Marc Rendl Ignacio <marcrendlignacio@gmail.com>,Tue Sep 26 00:03:03 2017 +0800," 
Since Rails 5, belongs_to validates the presence of the associated 
object, by default. The test ensures that non-spree models get the default behavior 
set by the Rails 5 main_app. In spree_core, we revert to the 
old belongs_to behaviour by setting a class method 
Spree::Base.belongs_to_required_by_default 
to always return `false`, instead of using the 
`ActiveRecord::Base.mattr_accessor :belongs_to_required_by_default`, 
which can affect other ActiveRecord models outside of spree_core. 
Otherwise, it can be problematic when we try to add Rails-5-ready 
engines that rely on the new default (belongs_to_required_by_default set to true). 
Unfortunately, since the class variable @@belongs_to_required_by_default 
has previously been set to false by Spree::Base before this commit, 
we've needed to also properly patch `FriendlyId::Slug.belongs_to :sluggable` 
to be `optional: true`, so that it conforms to new way of 
setting optional belongs_to associations in Rails 5. 
Before this FriendlyId patch, some factories that use FriendlyId::History, 
with deleted_at (acts_as_paranoid) throws a validation error. 
This patch can be removed when the corresponding FriendlyId 
issue has been resolved: https://github.com/norman/friendly_id/issues/822",""

Rails 5.0 supports generating a cache key from a scope, using a similar 
technique to what cache_key_for_taxons was using. This commit 
deprecates cache_key_for_taxons favour of using cache with a scope 
directly. 
Passing a scope or collection to `cache` will generate a hash based on 
the scope and MAX(updated_at) and COUNT(*). This is better than the 
existing helper because it takes the full scope into account and finds 
the max_updated_at and count values in a single query.",""

Javascript is sending indices starting from 0. 
acts_as_list has top_of_list defaulted as 1 - Source: https://github.com/swanandp/acts_as_list/blob/master/lib/acts_as_list/active_record/acts/list.rb#L38 
Steps to reproduce the Issue: 
1. Go to images under product. 
2. Take any element after the 1st one to the top. 
3. Edit the one at the top (that was just dragged) 
4. Coming back to the index page shows it in the 2nd position. 
What is happening in the frontend? 
1. Javascript sends the indices starting 0. 
2. The update_positions method in resource_controller just sets the positions as they were sent (with more stuff going on) 
3. When element in the 0th position is modified. acts_as_list figures 1 is the top of the list and sets the value to 1 along with setting anything which is already in position 1 to 0. 
This fix will not modify existing positions, but will only fix those resources for new updates. 
Another solution could be to set the configuration for all models which use acts_as_list to top_of_list: 0 which could be an alternative solution which fixes this issue from re-occurring in the first place.",""

When automatically creating a related record via delegated attributes prefer the 
`build_*` method instead of doing a straight assignment from an instance of the 
class of the related object. This ensures relationship constraints are followed. 
Without the meta-programming mess this is basically the difference between: 
and 
This is important because `Spree::Product.new(price: 0).master.is_master` will return `false` as 
the assignment of `price` (a delegated attribute) will cause a new variant to be assigned to master 
but that variant won't have the `is_master` flag automatically set. 
I believe this is sort of fixed up by `set_master_variants_default`[1] in the case of 
products but this is a more general fix. It might be worth investigating if the callback 
can be removed. Not causing any real performance issue but had having unnecessary 
code hanging around.

Our client needs to display different prices to different customers. The MOSS 
refactoring has enabled different prices for different tax zones, which is great, 
but they also need to display prices excluding VAT for *some* business customers. 
The logic for that is (while in accordance with EU tax law) rather custom. This PR 
is supposed only to enable passing more than just the tax zone as options for price calculation. 
In order to accomplish this, the `current_tax_zone` helper is replaced with a `current_price_options` 
helper which returns a Hash. All the values of that Hash are used to calculate product cache keys. 
I took care to order those so that we don't end up with different caches for the same content. 
* Remove current_tax_zone helper and replace with current_price_options 
* Adapt product cache key to price options hash 
* Adapt base helper to call #price_including_vat_for with price_options hash 
* Adapt price model for price_options hash 
* Adapt VAT price calculation module 
* Use new #included_tax_amount signature 
* Adapt tax_rate.rb 
* Adapt line_item.rb 
* Add tests for edge case price options

Prefer correctness over premature optimization. 
With the delete_all there is not a cascade delete of related objects including the inventory unit. 
When building an order on the backend this causes orphaned inventory unit records which 
manifest themselves confusingly in the RMA area as you have rows for each line item.

In German, to 'cancel' an order has to be a specific word (""stornieren"") that is different from e.g. 
canceling a UI dialog (""abbrechen""). Since ""cancel"" is used in the `event_links` helper for 
the `Cancel order` button, I get a (for a German) slightly confusing thing that hints at me being able 
to somehow ""close"" an order. 
This commit introduces namespacing just for this helper. I will also provide a PR to provide 
the necessary translations to the German translation in `spree_i18n`. 
Since other Spree extension might be using this helper and only provide non-namespaced event translations, 
I call `Spree.t` with `default: Spree.t(event)`.

Since adjustments on line_items were added there was no built in way to have them included 
into tax calculations. Currently adjustment_total includes all adjustments whether it be tax, 
promotions, etc. The problem is that tax was only calculated using amount + promo_total 
and not any other adjustments that were added onto the line_item. So if an adjustment altered 
the price in any way the tax would be incorrectly calculated. 
To remedy this this PR introduces two new columns to line_items, shipments and orders. 
The new columns (non_)taxable_adjustment_total are used to total all adjustments whose

When using factory_girl_rails and spring on an application, I found that none of the spree-provided factories were available to me. Using them when running the tests with spring resulted in `Factory Not Registered` errors. The factories work fine without spring. 
This seems to do with the factory_girl_rails initializer, which reloads all factories after spring forks. `require` happens only once, so when factory_girl reloads the factories it no longer sees the spree factories I have required. 
In my app, I changed `require ""spree/testing_support/factories` to `load ""spree/testing_support/factories.rb`, which will load each time that initializer is run. However, spree itself needs to `load` rather than `require` the individual factory files.

refund reason. That reason has to have the name set to `Return processing` 
and the `mutable` flag set to `false`. 
See https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/master/core/app/models/spree/refund_reason.rb#L5-L10 
Right now, there is no way to add RefundReasons in the backend either, so 
I guess this is more of a quick fix.

The initial intent of Spree::Alert was to push notifications from Spree Commerce 
to store owners when there were security alerts or new versions released. 
This functionality hasn't been used much though in the past several years 
with only a couple alerts issued for security updates.  The implementation 
was simply sticking the alerts in admin cookies, and has now taken up too much 
space causing CookieOverflow errors.  Since this feature isn't really being used, 
and most developers rather follow the https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/spree-user 
mailing list or the Spree Commerce blog & twitter accounts we're just going to 
remove it and shut down the alerts.spreecommerce.com service.

The `pre_tax_amount` column is used when calculating VATs. When the 
precision is too low for this field, rounding errors occur. 
For a line item with a price of 4.92 $ and a tax rate of 17%, the 
calculation has to go like this: 
``` 
4.92 / 1.17 = 4.205128205128205 
line_item.save 
--> 
``` 
Without this PR, whenever the line item is saved and reloaded, and then 
the taxes are re-calculated, the calculation wrongly goes like this: 
``` 
4.92 / 1.17 = 4.205128205128205 
line_item.save 
--> 
``` 
That's an error: `4.21 + 72 != 2.92`. 
This should not affect any display_* methods, as those use 
`Spree::Money`, which takes care of good rounding.

I just upgrade to ruby 2.2.2 and rails 4.2.1 and see this happened.

However, when I try to simply re-save a existing product. It gives me such error: 
``` 
2.2.2 :006 >   product = Spree::Product.first 
2.2.2 :009 >   product.save!

``` 
I check Product validators, found out this line: 
``` 
validates :slug, length: { minimum: 3 }, uniqueness: { allow_blank: true } 
``` 
It generate such validators which don't include allow_blank validation : 
``` 
2.2.2 :014 > Spree::Product.validators 
``` 
I modify it to this: 
``` 
validates :slug, length: { minimum: 3 }, allow_blank: true, uniqueness: true 
``` 
and the validators now are: 
``` 
[..., #<ActiveModel::Validations::LengthValidator:0x007ff9162d8478 @attributes=[:slug], @options={:allow_blank=>true, :minimum=>3}>, #<ActiveRecord::Validations::UniquenessValidator:0x007ff91333b788 @attributes=[:slug], @options={:case_sensitive=>true, :allow_blank=>true}, ...]

Which has allow_blank validation now.

1. Add current_tax_zone helper 
The `current_tax_zone` is needed for displaying the correct price 
including VAT. 
In order to cache product prices that depend on the current tax zone, 
we need to add the current tax zone to the cache key for a single or 
multiple products. 
2. Display correct VAT prices 
2. 1. Add Spree::Price#price_including_tax_for(zone) 
This methods returns the correctly calculated gross price 
for any zone that might have VAT. This way we can make sure to 
always include the correct VAT in prices (even if they differ). 
The method is delegated to Spree::Product and Spree::Variant. 
2. 2. Amend display_price helper to use current tax zone 
3. Copy price including VAT from Variant 
This enables us to always have the same price as displayed 
in the order. It also frees us from having to load default VAT 
rates in `tax_rate.rb`. 
The line item price will only ever be updated after the address 
step in the state machine. 
One expectation is changed in the back-end, because here the 
price of the line items is updated from the variant, and those are 
different. 
4. Refactor Spree::Zone and Spree::TaxRate 
When adjusting line items, do not include the default rates 
in the Array of applicable rates. This was only necessary because 
we could not be sure about the price being correct in the first place, 
which is now fixed through ´Spree::Price#price_inlcuding_vat_for(zone)´. 
As a consequence, I could refactor the stock estimator and fix 
https://github.com/spree/spree/issues/6234. 
5. Add rounding spec to tax_rate_spec.rb 
This is mainly for posterity: I got stuck in rounding hell once, and 
this test should ensure no-one else will have to. 
6. Fix reimbursement expectations 
The reimbursement spec expected negative adjustments for included tax, 
which aren't necessary anymore - if your local tax zone does not include 
the default VAT zone's VAT, the price is adjusted accordingly 
beforehand. 
7. Add test for MOSS taxes 
This is an elaborate almost-integration-test for a particular setup 
proving that it actually *is* possible now to configure Spree for MOSS. 
Add documentation for the new VAT handling 
* Release notes 
* Adapt taxation guide 
It also includes some of the corrections mentioned by members of the 
community.

The former value of `100%` will show logos (especially) SVGs too large (this only happens in Safari for me). 
Since the top bar is always `20px` high, it makes sense to also set this height to the logo. This way retina images and svgs always get the right height. In order to keep the ratio we need to set the `width` value as well.

Remove Spree::Money preferences 
This hurt performance since each instantiation of a Spree::Money object 
required 6 preference (and thus cache) lookups. 
RubyMoney does most of this better by default:

* symbol_first is configured by RubyMoney per-currency, this allows 
sign_before_symbol was the one exception, where our default was 
different (I would argue better) than the RubyMoney team's. So I have 
added Spree::Money.default_formatting_rules, which is analogous to 
Money..default_formatting_rules which has a default of 
{sign_before_symbol: true}. 
This Spree::Money.default_formatting_rules can also be used in place of 
the existing preference values.

button in the General Settings page ceases working, because the

This fix addresses this by refactoring the cache-clearing path into a

It is unclear what the previous code was trying to accomplish. I think 
it is safe to say that if the order is cancelled, and payment_total is 
zero, the payment state should be void. 
The existing code failed in the case of a single void payment.

Again, checking for a completed payment is wrong in the case of a void 
payment. Having a canceled order with a void payment or even no payment 
should have a outstanding_balance of 0.

Previously this would consider a promo used as long it was assigned to 
an order, even if this promo was not eligible (as in the case of when it 
was overridden by a better promo). 
In order to check if a promo was eligble, it needs to change the way the 
associations were joined, as it now needs to check on adjustments 
instead of just if the order is associated with the promotion. 
The test is changed to set up a full promotion with adjustments, and

The current suggestion causes problems in development environment (or any environment where classes are not cached). 
When rails autoreloads classes it first undefines them and then redefines them. However, the modules in the `xxx_decorator` files are just re-loaded without being undefined first.  See http://git.io/22TgYQ. That works fine for the `class_eval` approach but not for the include-module approach.

This corrects an issue which would leave the user on the confirm page 
when one of multiple payments failed. This would allow the user to 
proceed through the confirm step with an invalid payment, not billing 
them for the full amount required. 
An example would be with the store credit payment method, where they are 
able to pay for part of the order with store credit. Example, the 
customer has $20 store credit available and is trying to purchase a $100 
item. 
Currently, if attempting to charge $80 to the credit card fails (due to 
the card being declined), they $80 credit card payment will be flagged 
invalid, leaving only the $20 payment. The user would remain on the 
confirm page, which allows them to check out paying $20 on their store 
credit. The user will beleieve that everything worked correctly, however 
their $20 store credit has been consumed, but the order is still in a 
balance due state. 
This is fixed by only allowing an order to remain on the confirm page if 
they have sufficient payments to pay for the entire order.

It is unclear what the benefit of the callbacks were here. They're not 
demarking a change of state or something complex. They're just 
for inserting into the middle of a fairly short sequence of actions. 
With it broken into smaller methods, it's now fairly easy to override 
one of the methods and call super in a sub-class. 
Renamed ItemAdjustments as Adjustable::AdjustmentsUpdater 
This is a method object, not a model, so its more consistant to place 
it in a subfolder. It also doesn't operate an ""Item"" model, but on any

used for other models; the shipping calculators are contained in the 
Spree::Calculators::Shipping namespace. The shipment_method_factory

This enables promotions to have differing values for different

these models smaller and easier to reason about.

Had to override rspec-rails `routes=` because I couldn't figure other 
way to set the routes for all controller specs. 
Previously the build used the `use_route` approach which isn't really 
the proper supported way to run engine controller specs (current rails 
engines guides is misleading) 
This should also fix false positives on api controller specs 
Because the build used the :use_route key, tests would pass even when 
there would be no route configured for the particular request 
there's some conversation going on about the rails issue here

Mostly for the benefit of the specs under MySQL. 
This query was generating some sporadic spec failures for me when using MySQL as the database. This is because MySQL does not store fractional seconds so the ""created_at"" was sometimes the same value for two adjustments when running specs. And when created_at is identical the query below would actually pick the earlier adjustment instead of the more recent one.  Adding ""id"" as a fallback ordering fixes this problem and makes the behavior more deterministic. 
The issue is reproduceable in postgres as well by using Timecop.

This code is unreachable in stock spree because there is no route to get to Api::AddressesController without going through an order. 
And the unreachable code is insecure by default -- if a store did add an ""/api/address/:id"" route then any Api user would be able to read any other user's addresses simply by guessing the id because that's how the permissions were added in ability.rb. 
It seems like it would be better to just remove this or else make it a fully supported, reachable, and secure endpoint in stock Spree.

Steps to reproduce the issue: 
1. Add an order through the admin interface 
2. Attempt to pay via cheque for a user who has a credit card number 
stored in their profile. 
3. Submit the form 
This will 500, because params[:card] is set from the form on the initial 
page for the radio button from the credit card profiles. 
This is a simple, though incomplete fix for the issue. A proper fix 
would be to change the form so that params[:card] is qualified by the 
payment_method which it belongs. 
There are also likely issues with multiple payment methods which support 
profiles, as there is likely to be confusion between them. This should 
suffice for now.

Due to the way the rescue handlers are setup for the API, there's no easy way to alert Honeybadger/Airbrake/etc of an error in the API. Instead we have to check the client error JSON and debug from that which is not very ideal expecially if we don't control the client code. This is a simple change to let people decorate in a hook on ```error_during_processing``` so that we can notify on error. 
This should help me get rid of one more ```class_eval``` and ```alias_method_chain``` in my application. 
Thought this was more flexible then to have but open doing the KISS solution below: 
``` 
if defined?(Honeybadger) then Honeybadger.notify()

If an order qualifies for a line item promotion due to meeting some 
condition (say, 10% off 5 or more), and the cart is updated so that the 
line item promotion no longer qualifies, this will ensure that the line 
item promotion is set to zero. 
There is additionally some changes to hide promotions which are zero, as 
they're not super interesting. The promotions are zero-d out and hidden 
so that if at some point in the future the order re-qualifies, the 
amount will be set correctly.

Advancing the order after we add variants on the cart page. If we have already created shipments, then when we edit a line item the order gets reset to the address state. This call pushes it back to the payment state and destroys the old shipments, recreating them to match the new line item state. 
In checkout.rb we first create_proposed_shipments but here we check if addresses are valid. If not we need to destroy_all instead of delete_all so that the inventory_units that were created by create_propsed_shipments will also be destroyed and not clutter up the DB

Since upgrading to Spree 2.2, I've noticed exceptions getting thrown by, for instance [`cost + promo_cost`](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/2-2-stable/core/app/models/spree/shipment.rb#L151) throwing `NoMethodError: undefined method `+' for nil:NilClass`. 
Looking into my db schema, I see that virtually all decimal figures in Spree default to 0, but it looks like for some reason `spree_shipments.cost` didn't get that default. This migration helps ensure a smooth upgrade path from earlier Spree releases to 2.2.

Two advantages: 
1) Centralizes this logic, as we want this to happen whether you create 
an order from frontend, backend or API. 
2) Waits until the last possible moment to assign an address and will 
thus get the most recent default address, rather than the one at the 
time the cart was created. 
Make default address association safer 
It turns out that the state transition itself calls a save, so there is 
no need to add one more here. To make this even safer, we refuse to 
associate default addresses that are not valid.

I went to perform this migration on our production db while our store was in maintenance mode and realized it was going to take many hours -- it was loading some million or so Order objects, one at a time. 
The first change is that we go from loading all Adjustments and asking whether their adjustable is an Order to just scoping the Adjustment call to only ask for the ones that are. That saved us about one million `if` statements. 
The second change is to simply copy the `adjustable_id` over to `order_id` without ever fetching the Order -- who needs it? This saved us about one million ActiveRecord queries. 
Happy to pass the fruits along to others on the 2.1--2.2 upgrade path!

Introduces customer returns which represent getting merchandise back from the customer. The presence of a customer return (and it’s associated return items) indicate that a customer has returned something and the store has received it. A customer return also has an associated stock location which indicates where the customer has returned the merchandise. 
Customer returns replace the “Receive” button behavior in return authorizations. Receiving an RMA would be achieved by creating a customer return and selecting all the items in an RMA. Given that a customer return is not tied to a particular RMA, it allows a store to accurately represent what is returned. The logic to whether each particular item should be accepted or rejected will be handled in a future PR. 
Once the customer return is created, the admin can refund the customer for the customer return’s total amount similar to the refund button in RMA.

Spree::Product has after_save :touch in order to fire 
the after_touch callback. But as a result, every Save updates 
the product twice. There's no need to call `touch` 
after a save if all you want to do is fire the after_touch 
callback. So I fixed that. 
I also fixed `punch_slug`, which gets called after_destroy, 
so it does a single round-trip instead of about six. 
After a destroy has already happened, it is unnecessary to 
validate the product again, call callbacks again, touch the 
product again, and fire all cascading touches again.

When `ReturnAuthorization#process_refund` is called, the tax calculator is called with all return items and tax is calculated and stored on each return item and then the refund is performed with the new total. 
Taxation is broken out like this to allow easy integration with third-party tax services. 
Also: 
- Moved some rounding further out since it was causing small but noticeable differences in refund amounts (off by 8 cents sometimes, for example).  And increase precision of some return_items fields along with that. 
- Refactored return authorization controller specs so that the spec data is more correct 
- Added an additional validation to #process_refund to abort the refund if we know we don't have enough funds to reimburse the customer fully

Switches out Spree’s entire frontend for a bootstrap 3 powered frontend. 
This has several large advantages: 
- Fully responsive - Mobile, tablet and desktop. With custom grids for each, collapsing elements, and full HDPI support. Current spree only goes half way. 
- Just 44 lines of custom SCSS, replacing 1328 lines of undocumented spree CSS. Plus most of these lines only add some visual style to the header and footer and can be removed. 
- The entire frontend can be easily customized: colours, grid, spacing, etc, by just overriding [variables from bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_variables.scss) - giving a custom store design in minutes. 
- Bootstrap has some of the most [robust documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/css) of any framework, and a hugely active community. As this port uses only default bootstrap it means that entire spree frontend layout is documented by default. 
- Sites like [bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com) allow for one-file bootstrap drop-in spree themes. 
- Lots of [spree community will for bootstrap](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/spree-user/bootstrap/spree-user/B17492QdnGA/AF9vEzRzf4cJ). 
- Though this uses ‘full bootstrap’ for simplicity, you can remove the unused Bootstrap components you don’t require for minimal file sizes / weight. 
- Bootstrap is one of the largest most active open source projects out there - maintaining an entire framework just for spree makes little sense. Forget about cross browser bugs. Woo!",""

This is defined within line_item. It simplifies the code a little bit, 
plus now it has API compatibility with orders. This should hopefully 
allow us to remove some of the 3 percent off calculators that do almost

Extract quantity to it's own function. 
Quantity is used by some of the calculators, and this will maintain 
compatibility between calculators for use on both LineItems and Orders. 
It also simplifies some of the code! 
Add calcuators to LineItem adjustments. 
With some minor modifications these calculators now work with line items 
as well as whole orders.  This will allow store owners to set up 
discounts of a specified amount on a product or set of products, rather 
than only percentage discounts.

After spending a lot of time working on migrating old return authorization data, it's become clear that doing so would be too error prone without presenting considerable risk of damaging existing data.  And/or forever incumbering future development work on Spree by requiring lots of edge cases and special considerations for legacy data. 
Instead of migrating the old data, we instead renamed the existing table ""return_authorizations"" to ""legacy_return_authorizations"" and created a [spree_legacy_return_authorizations extension](https://github.com/bonobos/spree_legacy_return_authorizations).  Stores that are migrating from old versions of Spree can include that extension to continue viewing and closing-out their legacy data.  The extension does not allow creating any new legacy data. 
Some of the reasons that migrating old data would be dangerous are: 
- The old system used adjustments and negative payments to provide refunds, whereas the new system uses the ""Refund"" model. 
- The old system does not provide a direct (i.e. completely reliable) link between negative adjustments and return authorizations. 
- The old system does not provide a direct link between negative payments and return authorizations.  See above bullet, plus in the old system it was very possible to create a negative payment that refunded not only the return authorization but also any other negative adjustment that happened to be pending at the time of the negative payment. 
- The old system does not store tax amounts separately.  The new system will have fields dedicated to storing tax refund amounts, and trying to pull the data apart was proving very difficult and error prone, especially when you consider that tax zones may have been added/changed or tax rates changed since the time of the refund.  Leaving tax data blank for legacy data also presents unfortunate edge cases and problems. 
- The old system never marked a return authorzation as refunded, and figuring that out (see above items) was error prone.  And leaving the return authorzations as non-refunded in the new system could have dangerous side effects. 
All these things together made us think that we and other spree stores with legacy return data would be better served by keeping the old data as it was and providing the above extension to display and finish closing out any in-flight return authorizations.

3:34 PM <BAMbanda> dpritchett, it's mine, I created manually, following the guide 
3:35 PM <dpritchett> usually when i use a spree extension i 1) add it to my spree store's gemfile, 2) bundle install, 3) run the extension installer if necessary, 4) run the extension railties to generate migrations if necessary 5) run rake db: migrate if necessary 
3:35 PM <dpritchett> all this without ever messing with the extension 
3:35 PM <dpritchett> since it's your own extension you should know if you built an installer or any railties or whatever 
3:35 PM <dpritchett> but yeah you run all of that from within your spree app's context and not that of the extension 
3:36 PM <dpritchett> assuming your extension is self-contained in another folder outside of your app repo 
3:36 PM <BAMbanda> ok cool, I generated it though the spree comandline gem, outside my apps repo 
3:36 PM <dpritchett> rerun it inside your app's repo and it should put the migration in db/migrate 
3:36 PM <dpritchett> or you could just copy it over 
3:36 PM <dpritchett> (i think) 
3:37 PM <BAMbanda> yeah, that makes sense, ok thanks 
3:37 PM <dpritchett> i'm assuming you had a file like this in your extension: https://github.com/spree/spree_gateway/blob/master/lib/generators/spree_gateway/install/install_generator.rb 
3:38 PM <BAMbanda> yup I did 
3:38 PM <dpritchett> cool 
3:38 PM → chris_hmc joined (~chris_hmc@75-171-88-228.phnx.qwest.net)

Before this change, we could end up with multiple eligible promotions on 
the same order. This happened because changing the order (for example, 
by adding line items) rechecked the eligibility of promotions, 
potentially making multiple ones eligible, but forgot to re-choose the 
one best promotion. 
This change adds a call to the logic that chooses the best promotion any 
time the ```OrderUpdater``` recalculates adjustments. 
Adds test to ensure we do not apply multiple line item promotions 
Spec and style improvements 
Runs two specs twice with different ordering to ensure the order in 
which promos are applied doesn't matter. Also cleans up some style 
issues and removes an unnecessary stub. 
Add specs for taxable items + promos 
Correctly limit a promotion to its maximum amount 
You should never be able to reduce the price of an adjustable to less 
than zero. Thus, we have to guard against a promo applying a discount 
larger than the pre-promo amount. 
However, as we also do recalculations, we cannot just use the 
post-adjustment amount as a limit here. We have to use the 
pre-adjustment amount -- i.e. pre-tax, pre-promotions. That is correct 
because a) tax gets calculated on the post-promotion amount and b) there 
can only be one active promo per line item.

I believe the correct logic is to check params[:token] first, once params[:token] is available, session[:access_token] should always be overridden by params[:token]. 
Thanks.

orders placed via /admin were being charged twice. 
See these two lines from Spree::Admin::PaymentsController: 
For incomplete orders the first line will trigger callbacks that cause 
the payment to be charged if the order reaches the ""completed"" state. 
Then the second line will process the payment *again*, resulting in a 
double charge. 
We can't just remove the second line because orders that are already 
complete won't trigger any callbacks from the first line, so these 
orders need to have their payments charged manually. 
The effect of the bug in our case was that Braintree rejected the second 
(duplicate) billing on the payment, and this resulted in the Payment 
object being marked as failed when actually it succeeded on the first 
attempt. So it appeared from within Spree that a successful payment 
was a failed payment.

While running Spree in Dutch locale, adding a Payment recognizes the decimal separator as thousands separator. So when using the pre filled value (e.g. 45.21) this will be converted to a much larger amount (4521.00). The fix makes sure that a localized value is filled in (45,21 instead of 45.21).

This currently causes an issue with better_spree_paypal_express, and 
possibly other extensions. 
While Spree sets the session's order_id to nil when an order is 
complete, better_spree_paypal_express does not.  Therefore, a completed 
order can be retrieved as the simple_current_order. 
It makes sense to replicate the logic of current_order (which does not 
allow completed orders to be returned) here.

The original use case for this was to prevent the order to complete with 
payments in failed state. However this also prevents the order to 
complete when a payment was already authorised and marked as processing.

payment profile.

I saw [almost 200](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states) calls  to `Spree::Zone Exists (0.3ms)` and thought there must be a better way. 
Here we put the `@shipping_method.zones` into a local variable so we can hit that instead of the db. 
Notes: 
* The `to_a` method is necessary to force Rails to evaluate the `zones` scope. Otherwise we still get hundreds of db calls. 
* If we want to, we could always replace the array of `Zones` with an array of `ids` -- replacing `to_a` with `.pluck(:id)` and having the checkbox tag read `include?(zone.id)` instead of `include?(zone)`. However I'm not sure this additional change is necessary.

As discussed in https://github.com/spree/spree/issues/4479, the existing migration would generate inaccurate class names due to the fact that `demodularize` will only select the very last part of the class name. 
So, for instance, 
`Spree::Calculator::Fedex::Ground` would be changed to 
`Spree::Calculator::Shipping::Ground`, which would trigger an `uninitialized constant` exception. The desired new class name is 
`Spree::Calculator::Shipping::Fedex::Ground`, and this suggested PR will handle those class name changes more appropriately.

ORIGINAL AUTHOR: https://github.com/magnusvk 
Additional Notes: We discovered an issue with the Order API. Trying to get our change reviewed/accepted into Spree to minimize future upgrade pain points. 
extensive concurrency fixes across frontend, core, api 
these changes were made at the suggestion of Spree to get a more comprehensive fix in beyond API. 
* made current_order helper take hashey args to support multiple lock option 
* change existing code to use hashey args 
* renamed filters to have with_lock to indicate we are locking on the read. all of these filters were for write actions on the controller (from what i saw) 
* incorporated magnusvk fix for checkout api controller (https://github.com/bonobos/spree/commit/817be320dacca498d8c4bbf755c46458ec2b4dcf)

These two pieces of imformation are important for the API to allow clients to deliver ui/ux friendly product variant picker to users. 
The product.has_variants? allows clients to determine if the product is_master variant can be selected as a purchase-able option. This is the current functionality in Spree-Frontend: 
https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/master/frontend/app/views/spree/products/_cart_form.html.erb#L26 
The second change is an enhancement to the API that prevents users from picking variants that are not in stock. We can X it out or shade it out to indicate that it's a possible option but not available. The urrent Spree-Frontend doesn't even check for this, and instead warns of inventory on add-to-cart. This is less than ideal if we want to prevent people from getting into this dead-end and block the selection to begin with.

There are numerous drawbacks and ""gotchas"" in the current image_settings 
interface than I argue are worth keeping. 
Any changes you make to the settings need a server restart to actually 
work. Also, any changes to styles require a rake task to be ran on the 
backend. These changes must be completed by programmers and we do not 
gain anything supporting them in settings versus setting them in 
initializers. 
Settings can still be set by using Paperclip::Attachment.default_options,

object_params is one of the uglier areas of the code that is also 
frequently in need of expanding upon (who remembers the promo 
controller implementation?). 
rather than continually expanding and class_evaling over top of 
object_params, I have switched it to a callback based system that 
extensions can subscribe to and do whatever action is required. While 
all this changes is core is deprecates object_params for a single 
callback, in our ""live"" site, this fixes the integration of 3 separate 
extensions that deal with different payment types. 
The ugliest part to this commit by far is the @updating_params instance 
variable as a place to change the parameters, but I am very open to 
suggestions or alternate sub/pub methods than ActiveSupport::Callbacks 
From here, the next thing to do to clean it up farther is create a 
CheckoutRequest object to start wrapping the functionality of the params 
into cleaner portions.

A great example of this would be Australia's GST of 10% on some items.

On the receipt from a store, you would see GST tax amount included which is NOT addeed to the total. 
A great example of an additional tax would be the USA's Sales Tax, whereas on the shelf it may say 0 it could have a tax rate of 8.25%, resulting in the item *actually* costing 0.825.

The benefit of this change is two fold: 1) applying a promotional code is computationally difficult and may cause the payment to take longer than the user has patience for and 2) that you won't lose the payment information if the coupon code is invalid.

The default value of states_required column of :spree_countries table is 
true which makes the configuration option 
Spree::Config.address_requires_state essentially a no-op. Therefore, 
setting the aforementioned configuration option to false is not enough 
to remove the state requirement of a country. 
This commit adds a migration for the :spree_countries table with the 
name ChangeStatesRequiredForCountries which changes the default value of 
states_required to false. 
As the states_required value is now false, this value has to be set 
explicitly to true for federated states. Using the list of federated 
states from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_state set the 
states_required value of these states explicitly to true.

all orders if there is no information to base a tax rate off of. 
However, once we have enough information to determine the appropriate

which will apply.

With shipping calculators returning 0, we run the risk of choosing and charging 
a cost of $0 in cases where for example spree_active_shipping has a failed rate 
query with the carrier API. This could be a very expensive mistake. 
Current problem as it stands is that with spree_active_shipping returning nil, if 
the calculator returns nil, no other rate options are tried and the customer sees 
no shipping options in checkout.

With existing `ControllerHelpers::PermittedAttributes`, adding 
additional permitted attributes can only be done by overriding the 
method. To be done safely in extensions, this would rely on a lot of 
method aliasing. 
This introduces `Spree::PermittedAttributes`, which has as module 
attributes for the the accessible attributes on the spree models. This 
is easily modifiable by spree applications or extensions. 
`ControllerHelpers::StrongParameters` contains the same methods as 
before but mostly delegates to `Spree::PermittedAttributes`. The 
controller helpers also describe the allowed nested attributes. 
For more complex customization (ex. permissions depending on role), 
controllers can still override `permitted_attributes` with 
`SimpleDelegator` (or similar) or override `permitted_*_attributes` 
methods themselves to modify the attributes on a per request basis. 
Thanks to Hates, Radar, huoxito, and jstrong in #spree for quick 
discussion.

Turns out that Rails 4 introduced a `force_ssl_redirect` as well and 
so that method got overriden from within spree core. The spree 
implementation however expected the only param passed to be a string or 
something that we could assign :host and on Rails ForceSSL a hash is 
given instead so this statement would be true 
and users would get the error described in https://github.com/spree/spree/issues/3283 
Here's the current Rails ForceSSL implementation https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v4.0.0/actionpack/lib/action_controller/metal/force_ssl.rb#L66 
and in 3.2.14 https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v3.2.14/actionpack/lib/action_controller/metal/force_ssl.rb 
Removing the `force_ssl_redirect` from spree core seems to fix the issue 
as that method was just a copy of the old implementation of Rails 
`force_ssl` which is already called from spree SSL module 
Remove spec setting application.config.force_ssl true 
It doesn't represent a valid use case. By the time that code is run 
the application is already initialized so that really doesn't make any 
difference. We would have to add `force_ssl` inside the 
ProductsController class to make the spec pass, only that it breaks 
other specs so I believe we'd rather remove it 
In Rails 4 SSL application wide is taken care of a middleware called 
ActionDispatch::SSL which is included on the app load. Looks like 
`force_ssl` is only used on the Controller level",""

Every time a customer gets to the point where shipments were created, 
delivery step, and then decides to go back and change some item quantity 
or add a new product we need to recreate the shipments so they properly 
reflect the current order state. 
I initially tried to apply these changes on the spree_core level but it 
turns out to be really difficult because while both backend and frontend 
use the same API in backend inventory units are created as soon as items 
are included on the order. On the other hand in frontend inventory units 
are only created when customers reaches the delivery step

To fix this issue, was necessary adding a monkey patch to initialize 
the i18n after load the spree base controller. 
Also, I changed the method #t. Now this method is an alias to #translate. 
In my concept, we need to follow the same convention of i18n and 
translation helpers of rails. 
So, the developers can use #t and #translate without any problems.

When building shipment packages Spree assumed that every order item had 
an existing stock item in all stock locations. But that may not always 
be the case since the `propagate_all_variants` config was added to 
StockLocation in #3050 
I think we should move forward with this. Spree should be smart enough 
to figure out which order items exist in which stock locations. 
Honestly I don't like the implementation of this fix but it was the only 
one I could come up with for now.

used capybara `find` to check the visibility of elements and that method

And include %{value} for interpolation in validation messages. 
The current code hardcodes the I18n key and improperly assigns the error

* You cannot override the translation message for models/attributes 
* You cannot pass your own I18n key as a symbol (eg. :invalid_email) 
* You cannot use symbol interpolation

There's a couple of things to note in this commit. 
The first is that I've removed tokeninput.js. We *were* using it for autocomplete, but we're now using select2 for that. 
There's now a product searching 'API endpoint' in Core. This is a 'necessary evil' for the product searching to work, but will be removed when the changes from #2225 are merged. 
The select2 helpers within capybara_ext have been massaged a bit to correctly scope calls to their relevant elements, using Capybara's API more rather than depending on ugly JavaScript and sleep statements, and gotten closer to what I'd call sane code. 
In promo, the user picker code has been moved out into a new file at user_picker.js, and the product picker lives at product_picker.js. This is because dumping all your code in one file is what we did back in PHP-land, *not* what we're going to do in Spree. 
The user picker JS code is now also run when we create a new promotion rule for a user. This means that you won't need to refresh the page to see the field any more. Consider it a freebie. 
Finally, we're no longer testing the promotion rule for products using just model calls. We're actually stepping through the flow, as a user would, which is much better.",""

This issue exists for orders that split up their shipments over two or more shipments. 
What happens is that when a shipment is created for a single line item, 
the price of that shipment is x. The second time a shipment is created, 
for a different line item for the same order, that second shipment's price 
<shipping cost>*<line items count>, due to the automatic adjustment 
updating for an order. 
To fix this, we lock the adjustment for any 'calculated adjustment', so 
that it may not change once it has been calculated. An admin *may* 
choose to override the amount in the interface after the fact.

This is a bug with the cart form.  It would show the add to cart button 
if there was a valid price in the master currency rather than the 
current currency.  This causes the add to cart button to not display if 
the product is not available in the master currency but available in a 
different currency.

I discovered yesterday afternoon that Factory Girl isn't *really* appropriate for dealing with such a complex object as an Order within Spree. 
An Order comes in many different shapes and sizes and sometimes we want to deal with it at different points in it's 'life'. Creating factories for each of these points is rather difficult, and so I made the OrderWalkthrough class which is a no-bullshit class for walking through an Order up to a specific point and then working with that object. 
Ideally, this will help simplify a lot of the other integration tests within Spree that need to work within the context of an Order",""

This is because a LineItem may have extra information attached to it, which would be lost with the add_variant call 
Instead, what we do is one of two things: 
1) If the line item with that variant already exists then we increment the quantity for that line item and save it. Everyone goes home happy. 
2) If a line item with that variant doesn't exist, then we re-assign the old line item's order_id field to the current order object. 
Number #2 comes with a caveat: we *must* reload the old order's line items because otherwise the re-assigned line_items would be destroyed when order.destroy is called.

Fixes #2197 
Add currency parameter support to Spree::Money. 
Spree::Money now allows an optional currency parameter to be passed in, 
which will be used if specified.  In the case where it is not specified, 
the global spree configuration value will be used instead. 
The foundation of multi-currency support is going to be modifying the 
code to support storing the currency in the various objects used by 
Spree. 
The goal is to modify the code to allow: 
- adjustments 
- line items 
- orders 
- payments 
- return authorizations 
- shipments 
- shipping rates 
- variants 
to eventually store and track their own currency. 
Currently these objects mirror the global currency value.  As code 
support improves, this will be stored in the database for these models, 
or inferred from dependent models (for example, determining the line 
item currency from the order currency). 
Flagged money helper as deprecated 
The money helper is based around having a single site wide currency. 
This is instead being moved to a series of display_* calls on the models 
which have both the monetary amount and currency to produce its own 
Spree::Money object, which then allows us to display a properly 
formatted currency on the output. 
Split prices from variants & store currency in DB. 
This will allow a variant to have many prices in many different 
currencies. 
Store currency in database. 
Add currency to line items. 
Line items now support currency, which can be tracked on a line 
item basis. 
Add currency support to orders. 
Infer payment currency from order. 
Support currency on shipping. 
Base currencies off of order currency. 
Adjustment, Return Auth, and Shipment now infer their currency from the 
currency of their order.",""

The existing code for parsing prices (see https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/master/core/app/models/spree/variant.rb#L55-66) 
doesn't take into account entries for prices that use a different decimal separator than the full 
stop ("".""). This is true for almost all European and Latin American locales. 
Example: 
US: 15.99 = 15 dollars and 99 cents 
Other: 15,99 = 15 dollars and 99 cents 
If the product/variant edit form shows 15,99 (correct, because it uses `number_to_currency`) and 
one presses save, the code linked above throws away the comma and saves it as 1599 and it gets 
shown as 1.599,00 when the form is re-rendered (the full stop is the thousands delimiter here). 
When one saves again, it gets saved as 1.60 (actually 1.599 but of course rounded). 
This commit fixes the issues by taking into account locale settings for the decimal separator and 
the thousand delimiter and replacing characters accordingly.

The issue was that the previous state_machine definition was not correctly being removed, causing the callbacks for states to remain inplace, when really they should be reset every time checkout_flow is defined. There is now a test within spec/models/order/checkout_spec.rb which re-defines the checkout_flow within the Order class and then validates that the next event ""branches"" don't know anything about the states that shouldn't be there. This should be sufficient for testing that old states are removed. 
This commit also fixes a number of other, related problems: 
1) Subclasses of the Order class should not effect the parent class's state_machine definition. This was fixed by using class_attribute instead of using cattr_accessor. Really, I (Ryan) should've known better. 
2) checkout_steps was being incorrectly defined as an array, when it should be an ActiveSupport::OrderedHash instead 
3) Prevented method conflict errors by using StateMachine::Machine.ignore_method_conflicts. This was only needed due to changes from this commit.",""

While pairing with Avdi Grimm he noticed the return value from %x() is 
not used. Instead the variable $? is checked. A better approach is using 
'system' which will return true if the command executed successfully and 
then checking that value. It removes the need to check $? and also gets 
rid of the need for rescue. Another benefit is that testing this part of 
the code becomes easier.

This is so that the methods can be more easily overriden. Methods provided by a module cannot be overriden on what they are included into. For example, if Spree::BaseController kept including ControllerHelpers which was defining a spree_current_user method and an authentication extension attempted to override this method, it would not work. The method that would be called would be the dummy one included in ControllerHelpers. 
It never made sense to me to have ControllerHelpers only being included in one place. Therefore, let's just throw everything in the BaseController so it's more obvious to people where things come from. 
This will probably fix the issue where spree_current_user is nil on custom-auth apps",""

you were expecting, other times you would get the Stein included and not

This method will need to be called if app.config.initialize_on_precompile is set to false inside the application. This is because with this option set to false *no* initializers inside application or engine will be run... including our little hook to add some assets to precompile. 
This therefore causes the Spree assets that we so deeply care about to be blatantly ignored by the gorgeous Asset Pipeline. So we hack around it. 
Underneath config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false in your config/application.rb put this line: 
Spree::Core::Engine.precompile_assets! 
And all will be well.

This commit contains a whole bunch of changes, from pull request #1296 
which will fix #1292. 
To understand the gist of the problem, please see the comment threads in 
The main bunch of work that was done here was done in two parts: remove all current_user 
references from Core and to isolate each component during its testing so 
that it is not loading all of Spree for each component, just the 
bare-bones components that are needed. 
For instance, Core now will only load Core. API will now load API, Auth 
and Core. Dash will load Auth and Core. Promo will load Auth and Core.",""

Because this causes an issue (#881) where it attempts to load a class that is unloadable at that point in time.

This is so the rescue_from for CanCan::AccessDenied is loaded into Spree::BaseController first. 
Otherwise, what happens is that Spree::Admin::BaseController gets defined, which loads Spree::BaseController and inherits its class_attributes from that. One of these is rescue_handlers, which at this stage is an empty array. This means that when this controller (or, more likely, one of its descendants) raises the CanCan::AccessDenied exception, the rescue handler is not registered and so the exception causes a *real* exception. 
By loading it before hand, the rescue_from call runs on Spree::BaseController before Spree::Admin::BaseController is loaded, meaning that when Spree::Admin::BaseController is *finally* loaded it inherits the rescue_handlers attribute from Spree::BaseController, so that when the CanCan::AccessDenied exception is thrown it is correctly rescued from.

Therefore we need to tell it when it re-defines the Spree::Product class to extend it with the Scopes module which is now defined within this file. When the extend method is called it calls extended on the module which adds the scopes + class methods it needs for the functionality",""

When you call self.arguments it returns an array like [shirt]. In Ruby 1.8.7 when this object is converted to a string it is printed as shirt. 
The api/features/products.feature's scenarios all pass in 1.8.7 because of this. 
But in 1.9.2 it's actually written as [""shirt""]. A subtle difference, but it causes problems where it attempts to find a product where the name contains that 'inspected' version of the arguments, rather than the arguments literally. 
By calling .join(""""), we work around this problem. 
That was fun to debug",""

This commit fixes an issue in the Address page of the checkout process.  The Country and State controls were not working as expected in IE8, IE7, or IE6.  The State control was displaying as a textbox when United States was selected as a country. 
The fix consists of making the jQuery search expressions more specific.  That way jQuery can find the controls it needs to manipulate when the user selects a country. 
For some reason, the existing code was working in other major browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox).  This fix preserves the behavior in those browsers.",""

Currently Spree::PreferenceAccess always uses rails cache with the key :""Spree::Config"". If a developer decides to overwrite Spree::Config::instance method to return the AppConfig instance based on some varying criteria he will face unpredicted results when using Spree::Config[] accessor. 
This commit changes the cache key to :""configuration_#{config.id}"". This doesn't change anything for projects that don't monkey patch Spree::Config::instance, but fixes configuration access for those that do.

The plugin in which Spree based it's preferences system used a name 
that's now reserved by ActiveRecord. 
I mostly manually applied the original authors fix to Spree 
http://github.com/pluginaweek/preferences/commit/08cf4b9bddea8aac45c2c79215f1b1810d7dbf2e 
Rename Preference#attribute to #name to avoid conflicts with reserved methods in 
ActiveRecord 
I didn't apply everything and most importantly I didn't fix the tests. 
I just got it working enough so I could finish something else :P

That was actually a side effect of my replacement of link_to by button_for on the ""Empty cart"" button. 
While that is, imo, a better option, in this case, because it was already inside of a form, it didn't work correctly. 
button_for wrapps the button into a form, the nesting of the ""empty cart"" form inside of the cart form caused the browser to think it was a single form, thus, sending the _method=delete key on the submit (update) request. 
I turned it back to link_to and added the new Rails3 UJS (jQuery driver) into Spree, which is something we would have to do sooner or later :)",""

All named_scope occurrences in the code have been removed, including 
those in the awesome_nested_set plugin; however, there are a few caveats: 
- no testing has been done (I haven't set up for tests yet), not even

This is helpful for extension creators who wish to render this template 
from within a controller other than the Admin::OrdersController. By 
default, the will_paginate method derives the collection name from the 
controller name which would mistakenly be 'orders' in an extension that 
renders this template. By explicitly setting the collection to 
@orders the template will always render correctly, regardless of the controller that renders it. 
This is a trivial change that I don't believe needs testing as @collection 
is already tested well in resource_controller.

To support manipulation of unsaved PGs, I've shifted the 
test for an ordering scope back to Ruby (was a named scope). 
Also relaxed the test too - it now looks for ascend_by/descend_by 
OR having :order set in the :find scope. This allows scopes to 
be used which aren't in the restricted list for the admin interface. 
The Taxon scopes have also been tweaked: neither scope now gives an :order 
since this often interferes with the chosen ordering

* some typos fixed 
* by_popularity is renamed to descend_by_popularity (to match the pattern of other ordering scopes) 
* there's an admin setting to control the PG preview size 
* calculation of the preview (count and product list) is now done in model (taking advantage of some faster calls - eg counting is now done on the _unsorted_ cached result since sorting doesn't change the count) 
* caching happens after saving (it was caching old information...) 
* caching operates directly on the join table, avoiding overheads of calculating results in rails, with fast deletion and regeneration of the group (which currently omits sorting for extra speed) 
* the old order field has been ignored in favour of the new order_scope mechanism, and corresponding tests updated (I've had to disable some of the functional tests: we need to extend these to test the caching) 
The end result is that ALL modifications of a product group should not take much more than 5 seconds 
on over 100k of products (using mysql).

Previously this test case was inheriting from vanilla Test::Unit::TestCase, 
which does not wrap each test in a transaction.  Because of this there was 
logic to delete the objects and use of find_or_create_by.  By using 
ActiveSupport::TestCase we get each test wrapped in a transaction and it is 
no longer necessary to have the extra logic.

This commit introduces a lot of changes, all should be backwards 
compatible, except for change of behaviour of charge recalculating for 
completed orders. 
- Separate TaxCharge and ShippingCharge back into separate classes 
- Separate CouponCredit nto separate class and inherit from Credit < 
- Introduce #applicable? method for Adjustment to determine if charge is 
- After amount for adjustment is saved(during Order#complete), it's no 
- updated fixtures and factories to produce new types of charges 
- introduced test to check new adjustment functionality 
- removed 'secondary_type' column since it's no longer needed 
- Moved the completed_at to order model from checkout 
These changes are more in line with my initial charges design, they solve 
problem of charges beeing recalculated after order is completed, should 
be much easier to extend (by simple sublclasing of either Charge 
Adjustment or Credit), previous approach required overriding of 
parent class when adding new charge/credit type.

This allows quick entry of similar products by cloning an existing product. 
All of the source product's attributes are duplicated, and the taxons, 
properties, and image structure is cloned. The product's master variant 
is always cloned and its images cloned. If the product has (real) variants, 
just the option types are copied. 
Products may have application-specific fields, so there's a hook 
""duplicate_extra"" which can do extra adjustments on the cloned 
object before it gets saved. 
The permalink will need to be adjusted via other means.

This fix gets the save filters to return false if a 
problem is detected (and so halts the filter chain 
and save operation), and adds extra checking in the 
controllers to report if problems are detected. 
It is expected that the ""unexpected error"" messages should only 
arise from system bugs, and thus only rarely be seen by users. 
Additionally, problems in complete_order are caught and 
written to the log. Confirmation emails are now sent before 
the inventory change and final save, just in case there is 
a bug-related failure later on.

""mirror_files"" has been generalised to work on single files (for consistency), 
and will create backups with a ~ suffix if passed a flag. It also only copies 
new files when the content has changed (before, it was testing identity up to

in the upgrade task, the same operation is used on all things to be copied

silent over-writing.

these is the -b option, so some DIY is needed.

This was due to a reload in update_totals wiping any changes from 
form updates etc. 
I've opted for the simplest fix for now - remove the reload 
AND fixed the need for the reload. update_line_items was 
deleting records but leaving the line_items list unchanged. 
It now removes the defunct records from the list, thus removing 
the need for a reload. 
Dropping the reload should only cause problems if line items 
get changed independently of the parent order, and I don't 
believe this occurs in the code.

This adds the ability to narrow down searches by selecting a number of filters, 
eg sets of price ranges, or product properties, or ... The framework is very 
flexible and should accommodate pretty much anything. 
I've piggy-backed this onto the product controller's taxon filtering, so it won't 
affect sites that use the taxon preview code (the default) or have over-ridden 
the product index page. Access the new functionality by visiting /?taxon=1000 
The key idea is to use Rails' nested param arrays and SearchLogic's style of *_any 
scopes to drive some user-defined filters. SearchLogic v2 was incredibly useful 
here. There's very little code added to the core: the bulk of the code is the 
site-specific scopes and filters. 
There's three parts to this code: 
1. the definition of the filters in lib/product_filters.rb -- the comments here are 
2. linking taxons to filters, via ""applicable_filters"" in the model -- this just 
3. displaying the filters on web pages -- this is general purpose code which sets 
Note that this filtering framework can be applied to other objects, eg orders; and 
the SearchLogic params hash is an adequate representation for a set of products, so 
we can use the union of such searches to restrict coupon applicability etc.

with the id of the current active address (ie order.{bill,ship}_address.

This is the simplest form of address book: each user contains their last 
used ship and bill addresses, and these are used as defaults in their 
next checkout. If any edits are made, these are saved as new records - 
the previous addresses are not modified (though administrators can 
still fix errors if needed). At the end of checkout, the (ids of the) 
resulting addresses are saved to the user. 
Extracted from swistak's work on #54, with a few simplifications, 
in particular that the checkout controller determines whether or not 
a fresh address is needed - since it has all of the relevant info, 
and that addresses can only be edited in the checkout page. 
It is expected that further address book functionality will be added 
as an extension.

When in ""whiny"" mode, Paperclip catches its exceptions and 
converts them into an errors list which will cause validation 
(of the image) to fail. 
However: the paperclip errors aren't very informative, so an

installation and the original image file.

Fix for 463. Revised the checkout process so that creditcard info is held entirely in memory and only persisted (with number/cvv blanked) when the order succeeds; also clarified the get/post behaviour 
Highlights: 
* logic for GET/POST/PUT cleaned up, drawing on Ethan Rowe's useful comments in 
* creditcard info is stored entirely as an object attribute and not persisted. It is 
* creditcards association removed from order side - need to go through payments now 
* the (single) shipment is only created when the order is completed 
* interface to shipping calculator IS UNCHANGED 
* order.save! now used - silent failure not really an option
